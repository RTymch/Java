whose reversal is also a prime. For example, 17 is a prime and 71 is a prime, so 17
and 71 are emirps. Write a program that displays the first 100 emirps. Display 10
numbers per line, separated by exactly one space, as follows:
13 17 31 37 71 73 79 97 107 113
149 157 167 179 199 311 337 347 359 389
